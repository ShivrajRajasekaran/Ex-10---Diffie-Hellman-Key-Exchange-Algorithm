# Ex-10---Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-Algorithm

# Aim
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm in C. This algorithm allows two parties to securely exchange a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel without the need to transmit the key directly.

# Algorithm

## Key Exchange Steps:

1. Two parties agree on a large prime number P and a primitive root G, which are public values.
2. Each party selects a private key (a for Alice, b for Bob).
3. Each party computes their public key:
4. Alice computes A = G^a % P
5. Bob computes B = G^b % P
6. The public keys A and B are exchanged between the parties.
7. Both parties compute the shared secret key:
8. Alice computes the key as Key = B^a % P
9. Bob computes the key as Key = A^b % P
10. The shared key generated by both parties will be identical and can be used for further encryption.

# Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

// Function to perform modular exponentiation
long long int power(long long int base, long long int exp, long long int mod) {
    long long int result = 1;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp % 2 == 1)
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
        exp = exp / 2;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Publicly known values: large prime number and primitive root
    long long int P = 23;  // Prime number
    long long int G = 5;   // Primitive root of P

    // Private keys selected by Alice and Bob
    long long int a = 6;   // Alice's private key
    long long int b = 15;  // Bob's private key

    // Public keys calculated by Alice and Bob
    long long int A = power(G, a, P);  // A = G^a % P
    long long int B = power(G, b, P);  // B = G^b % P

    // Exchange public keys (A and B) over the network

    // Both compute the shared secret key
    long long int keyA = power(B, a, P);  // Key calculated by Alice: (B^a) % P
    long long int keyB = power(A, b, P);  // Key calculated by Bob: (A^b) % P

    // The shared key must be the same for both Alice and Bob
    printf("Shared secret key calculated by Alice: %lld\n", keyA);
    printf("Shared secret key calculated by Bob: %lld\n", keyB);

    return 0;
}

```

# Result:

The program successfully demonstrates the key exchange process, where both parties calculate the same shared secret key without directly transmitting it.
